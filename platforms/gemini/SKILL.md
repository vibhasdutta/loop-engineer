  Loop engineering wizard for Gemini CLI. Asks 2 questions, then orchestrates
  a fully autonomous agent team (resource-scout, researcher, planner,
  agent-factory, executor, evaluator, verifier, auditor, memory-keeper) until the goal is met.
  Each agent is a named tool. On Gemini CLI v0.36+, subagents run in true
  parallel (spawn multiple in one turn); on older versions, invoke one at a
  time. Dynamic researcher count. Persistent memory, git integration, resume
  support.

# Loop Engineer (Gemini CLI)

You are running a loop engineering wizard. Follow these phases in order.

---

## Phase 0 — Resume Check

Run the resume-check script FIRST — unconditionally. It is the source of truth; do not scan `loop-stack/` yourself.

**Bash:** `bash ~/.gemini/skills/loop-engineer/scripts/check-resume.sh`
**PowerShell:** `& "$env:USERPROFILE\.gemini\skills\loop-engineer\scripts\check-resume.ps1"`

Read its output literally, then branch:

**`ACTIVE <id> | State: ... | Task: ... | Progress: ...`:**
- Continuation intent ("continue", "proceed", "finish", "resume", "pick up", "fix what", "audit findings", "where we left") → auto-resume to Phase 5 without asking.
- Otherwise show State/Current Task/Progress, ask: Resume or Fresh?
  - Resume → skip to Phase 5.
  - Fresh → delete `loop-stack/<id>/` only (keep `.gemini/agents/`), continue to Phase 1.
- Multiple `ACTIVE` lines → list all, ask which to resume or 'fresh'. Continuation intent → auto-resume most recently modified.

**`DONE <id>` or `EXTENDED_DONE <id>` (no `ACTIVE` line) + continuation intent:**
→ **EXTEND SEQUENCE** — reopen in place, don't restart:
1. Rename `loop-stack/<id>_DONE/` (or `_EXTENDED_DONE/`) → `loop-stack/<id>_EXTENDED/`.
2. Reuse existing PLAN.md, RESEARCH.md, MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md, AGENTS.md, `agents/` as-is — do not re-run researchers, resource-scout, or agent-factory.
3. Ask ONE question: "What's the next task for this loop?" Append under `## Extension {N} Goal` in PLAN.md.
4. Invoke `planner` once against the new goal (existing RESEARCH.md/TOOLS.md as context) to append new `[GN]` tasks.
5. Reset STATUS.md: State = IN_PROGRESS, Current Task = first new task, Task Progress updated.
6. Go directly to Phase 5 (skip Phase 1–4).

On completion of a loop directory containing `_EXTENDED`: Phase 6 renames it to `_EXTENDED_DONE` instead of plain `_DONE`.

**`NONE`, or `DONE`/`EXTENDED_DONE` with no continuation intent:** → Phase 1 (fresh loop).

**RESUME/EXTEND RULES — always apply when going to Phase 5 this way:**
Skip Phase 2, 3, and 4 entirely. Read STATUS.md + PLAN.md to find where the loop stopped. Reuse existing RESEARCH.md, MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md, AGENTS.md — do not re-run startup agents.

> **To update loop-engineer:** `gemini skills update loop-engineer` or re-run `install.sh --update` / `install.ps1 -Update -Gemini`. Updates are never applied automatically mid-loop.

## Phase 1 — Core Wizard

**Q1:** "What do you want the loop to accomplish? (1-2 sentences)"

Generate LOOP_ID: lowercase slug, first 4 meaningful words, max 24 chars.
Auto-set: `STOP_CONDITION` = "all tasks in loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/PLAN.md checked", `MAX_TURNS` = 20.

**Q2:** "Should the loop auto-commit after each verified task? (yes / no)"

---

## Phase 2+3 — Initialize Loop

Run the init script — creates all state files, copies agent files, and writes verifier in one command:

**Bash (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
bash ~/.gemini/skills/loop-engineer/scripts/init-loop.sh \
  --loop-id <LOOP_ID> \
  --goal "<GOAL>" \
  --stop "all tasks in loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/PLAN.md checked" \
  --git <yes/no> \
  --platform gemini
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.gemini\skills\loop-engineer\scripts\init-loop.ps1" `
  -LoopId "<LOOP_ID>" `
  -Goal "<GOAL>" `
  -Stop "all tasks in loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/PLAN.md checked" `
  -Git <yes/no> `
  -Platform gemini
```

If the script is missing, install the skill first:
```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/vibhasdutta/loop-engineer
# or local: gemini skills link ./loop-engineer
```

The script creates `loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/`, `.gemini/agents/` with all agent .md files + knowledge-sources/, and `verifier.md` with the actual stop condition substituted.

---

## Phase 4 — Startup Sequence

Invoke agents by calling their named agent tool (each agent in `.gemini/agents/` becomes a callable tool).

**Check your Gemini CLI version first** (`gemini --version`, or check for parallel subagent support in your build):
- **v0.36+**: subagents run in **true parallel** — call multiple agent tools in the same turn/response and Gemini CLI's scheduler dispatches them concurrently. Use this for every "parallel" step below.
- **Older versions**: no concurrent subagent dispatch — invoke each agent in turn, wait for completion, then invoke the next.

### Step 1 — RESEARCHERS (dynamic count, parallel on v0.36+)

Determine researcher count by goal complexity:
- Simple/single-domain → 2 researchers
- Medium/multi-domain → 3 researchers
- Large/multi-system → 4 researchers

**Call all researcher agent tools in the same turn** (v0.36+: they run concurrently; pre-v0.36: invoke one at a time and wait for each):

Domains to distribute:
- **Context & Prior Work**: source structure, patterns, package files, tests
- **External Knowledge & Resources**: README, docs/, external APIs, .env.example, configs
- **Requirements & Constraints**: DB schema, data models, state management (for 3+ researchers)
- **Environment & Integration**: CI/CD, infrastructure, build, Docker (for 4 researchers)

Each researcher prompt:
```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
Focus: {ASSIGNED_DOMAIN} — {specific files and concerns}
GLOBAL DATA FIRST: read loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md and loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md.
Write findings to loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/RESEARCH.md under "## {Domain Name}".
Update STATUS.md "Last Researcher Result".
```

Wait for all researchers to complete before Step 2.

**Stuck-agent check (you do this yourself — no subagent):** if a researcher took much longer than the others, check its heartbeat line in STATUS.md `## Active Heartbeats`. If stale, treat it STUCK, note it, and proceed with the findings you have.

### Step 2 — RESOURCE SCOUT

Invoke the `resource-scout` agent:
```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
Check loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md — if < 7 days old, reuse. Otherwise discover all tools.
Write to loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/TOOLS.md AND loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md.
```
Wait for subagent to complete.

### Step 3 — PLANNER

Invoke the `planner` agent:
```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
Read RESEARCH.md (all sections) and TOOLS.md.
Create 3–7 tasks with parallel group tags [G1], [G2], etc.
Same group = parallel (independent files). Different group = sequential dependency.
Replace "## Tasks" in PLAN.md. Update STATUS.md.
```
Wait for subagent to complete.

Write `loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/AGENTS.md` with `# Specialized Agents\n## Status\nNONE CREATED YET`. (Agent-factory is on-demand, not a fixed step — see Rules.) Auto-continue into outer loop.

---

## Phase 5 — Outer Loop

**FULLY AUTONOMOUS. Never pause for user input.**

Initialize: `turns_used = 0`, `skipped_tasks = []`.

**v0.36+**: call multiple agent tools in the same turn wherever a step says "parallel" — Gemini CLI runs them concurrently. **Pre-v0.36**: invoke each agent, wait for completion, then invoke the next, even for "parallel" steps.

### Iteration steps:

1. **Budget check** — over MAX_TURNS → Phase 6.

2. **Read state** — identify current parallel group (all unchecked [GN] tasks).

3. **RESEARCHERS (parallel)** — one per task in batch (2 if batch=1), all called in the same turn on v0.36+.
   Each appends to RESEARCH.md. Increment turns_used.

4. **Before executors, check AGENTS.md.** For every task in the batch that clearly needs domain expertise beyond a generic executor and has no specialist yet, call `agent-factory` for all of them in the same turn (v0.36+: concurrent) to create their agent files and update AGENTS.md. Skip this for most tasks.

5. **EXECUTORS (parallel)** — one per task, all called in the same turn on v0.36+:
   ```
   Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
   GLOBAL DATA FIRST — read loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md AND loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md.
   Read MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md, PLAN.md, STATUS.md.
   READ: RESEARCH.md "## Task-Specific Research — {this_task}".
   Current task: {this_task}. Scope: only files for this task.
   Implement. Append discoveries to MEMORY.md. Update STATUS.md.
   Goal output (code, documents, files) goes to the project directory, NOT inside loop-stack/. loop-stack/ is state-only.
   ```
   Increment turns_used.

6. **MEMORY-KEEPER checkpoints (parallel)** — one per task. Local only.

7. **EVALUATORS (parallel)** — one per task.

8. **VERIFIERS (parallel)** — one per task.

9. **Process verifier results**:
   - PASS → auditor
   - FAIL < 3 → retry from step 3
   - FAIL ≥ 3 → auto-skip

10. **AUDITORS (parallel)** — one per passing task.

11. **Process audit results**:
    - CLEAN/WARN → proceed
    - BLOCK → auto-fix (one executor retry + re-verify). Still BLOCK → auto-skip.

12. **MEMORY-KEEPER final** — single invoke, local + global write.

13. **Advance** — mark [x], git commit if enabled. Find next group.
    None → ALL DONE → rename `loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/` → `loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>_DONE/` (or `_EXTENDED_DONE/` if this was an extended loop) → Phase 6.

## Phase 6 — Completion Report

Write `REPORT.md` inside the renamed loop directory and print summary.

---

## Rules

- Phase 0 first — run the check-resume script, never scan `loop-stack/` by hand.
- **File copy**: `cp ~/.gemini/skills/loop-engineer/agents/*.md .gemini/agents/` — never manual.
- **Global data first**: every agent reads `.global/MEMORY.md` + `.global/TOOLS.md` before acting.
- **Parallel on v0.36+**: Gemini CLI added true concurrent subagent dispatch in v0.36 (April 2026) — call multiple agent tools in the same turn for any "parallel" step and they run concurrently. Confirm your version with `gemini --version`. Ordinary (non-subagent) tool calls remain sequential regardless of version.
- **Pre-v0.36 fallback**: no concurrent dispatch exists — invoke each agent, wait, then invoke the next, even for steps marked "parallel" above.
- **Researcher before executor**: always. Dynamic count based on goal complexity.
- **Agent-factory is on-demand, not a fixed phase step.** Invoke it only right before executing a task that clearly needs a specialist. Most loops never call it.
- **knowledge-sources.md is a reference file researchers consult on demand**, not a phase step.
- **No watcher agent.** Check heartbeats yourself if an agent is slow; never invoke a dedicated watcher.
- **Memory-keeper twice per batch**: checkpoint (local) after executors, consolidation (local+global) after audit.
- **Executors append to MEMORY.md directly** during work.
- **Planner**: once at startup after researchers + resource-scout, and again (lightweight) for extended-loop follow-on tasks. Tasks MUST use [G1]/[G2] group tags.
- **Fully autonomous**: no pauses. 3 fails → auto-skip. BLOCK → auto-fix once → skip.
- **HARD RULE — no plan-approval gate**: after Phase 1's two questions, proceed through Phase 2 onward without presenting a plan for approval or waiting for a "click proceed" confirmation.
- On completion: rename to `<LOOP_ID>_DONE/` or `<LOOP_ID>_EXTENDED_DONE/`.
- **GEMINI.md**: copy `platforms/gemini/GEMINI.md` to the project root if not present — it guides skill activation.
- **Checkpointing**: Gemini CLI auto-checkpoints sessions. Loop state in `loop-stack/` survives context resets independently — both layers complement each other.
- **Project-level MCP config**: `.gemini/settings.json` in the project root overrides global settings — resource-scout checks both.
