  Domain-agnostic autonomous loop for any goal — coding, research, content, data,
  automation, or any objective. Asks 2 questions, then orchestrates a self-assembling
  agent team (resource-scout, researcher, planner, agent-factory, executor, evaluator,
  verifier, auditor, memory-keeper) that researches, discovers resources, builds
  specialized agents for the goal, executes, and iterates until done. Supports
  resume, persistent memory, git integration, and generates a completion report.

# Loop Engineer

You are running a loop engineering wizard. Follow these phases in order.

---

## Phase 0 — Resume Check

Before anything else, scan for any `loop-stack/*/STATUS.md` files in the current directory.
**Skip any directory whose name ends with `_DONE` — those loops are already complete.**

**If none found (excluding `_DONE` folders):** continue to Phase 1.

**If one found:** Read it and tell the user:
> "Found an existing loop: loop-stack/{loop-id}/
> State: {State}  |  Current task: {Current Task}  |  Progress: {Task Progress}
>
> Resume this loop or start fresh?"

- **Resume** → skip to Phase 5 (Outer Loop) using existing files in `loop-stack/{loop-id}/`.
- **Fresh** → delete only `loop-stack/<loop-id>/` directory (do NOT delete `.claude/agents/`), continue to Phase 1.

**If multiple found:** List them all and ask which to resume or type 'fresh'.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Wizard

Ask **one at a time**. Wait for the full answer.

**Q1 — Goal:**
> "What do you want the loop to accomplish? (1-2 sentences)"

After storing GOAL, generate LOOP_ID:
- lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric runs with hyphens
- Take first 4 meaningful words (skip: a, an, the, to, for, of, in, on, with, and, or)
- Max 24 chars, strip trailing hyphen
- Example: "Add authentication flow to the REST API" → "add-auth-flow-api"

Auto-set: `STOP_CONDITION` = "all tasks in loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/PLAN.md checked", `BUDGET_STRING` = "20 turns", `MAX_TURNS` = 20.

**Q2 — Git integration:**
> "Should the loop auto-commit after each verified task? (yes / no)"

Store: `GOAL`, `LOOP_ID`, `STOP_CONDITION`, `BUDGET_STRING`, `MAX_TURNS`, `USE_GIT`.

---

## Phase 2 — State File Creation

Create `loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/` directory and write these files:

**loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/PLAN.md** (tasks section is a stub — planner will fill it in Phase 4):

    # Loop Plan
    ## Goal
    {GOAL}
    ## Stop Condition
    {STOP_CONDITION}
    ## Budget
    {BUDGET_STRING}
    ## Git Integration
    {yes / no}
    ## Tasks
    (will be created by the planner agent)

**loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/STATUS.md:**

    # Loop Status
    ## State
    IN_PROGRESS
    ## Current Task
    (planning in progress)
    ## Task Progress
    0 / ? complete
    ## Attempts On Current Task
    0
    ## Completed Tasks
    (none)
    ## Skipped Tasks
    (none)
    ## Last Researcher Result
    (none)
    ## Last Executor Result
    (none)
    ## Last Evaluator Result
    (none)
    ## Last Audit Result
    (none)
    ## Blocked Reason
    (none)

**loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/MEMORY.md:**

    # Loop Memory
    Updated continuously by all agents as they discover things.
    ## Learnings
    (none yet)

**loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/TOOLS.md:**

    # Discovered Tools
    ## Status
    PENDING

**loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/RESEARCH.md:**

    # Research Log
    ## Context & Prior Work
    (pending)
    ## External Knowledge & Resources
    (pending)
    ## Requirements & Constraints
    (pending)
    ## Task-Specific Research
    (pending)

**loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/AGENTS.md:**

    # Specialized Agents
    ## Status
    PENDING (agent-factory will populate after planning)

Create `loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/agents/` directory (agent-factory will write specialist agents here).

Initialize global memory if not present:
- `loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md` — create with header if missing

---

## Phase 3 — Agent File Setup

**CRITICAL: Use shell commands to copy agent files. Do NOT write them manually — they must be copied exactly from the installed templates.**

Create `.claude/agents/` if it does not exist, then run:

**Bash (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents
mkdir -p .claude/agents/knowledge-sources
cp ~/.claude/skills/loop-engineer/agents/resource-scout.md .claude/agents/
cp ~/.claude/skills/loop-engineer/agents/researcher.md .claude/agents/
cp ~/.claude/skills/loop-engineer/agents/planner.md .claude/agents/
cp ~/.claude/skills/loop-engineer/agents/agent-factory.md .claude/agents/
cp ~/.claude/skills/loop-engineer/agents/executor.md .claude/agents/
cp ~/.claude/skills/loop-engineer/agents/evaluator.md .claude/agents/
cp ~/.claude/skills/loop-engineer/agents/auditor.md .claude/agents/
cp ~/.claude/skills/loop-engineer/agents/memory-keeper.md .claude/agents/
cp ~/.claude/skills/loop-engineer/agents/knowledge-sources/*.md .claude/agents/knowledge-sources/
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force .claude\agents | Out-Null
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force ".claude\agents\knowledge-sources" | Out-Null
Copy-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\loop-engineer\agents\*.md" ".claude\agents\"
Copy-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\loop-engineer\agents\knowledge-sources\*.md" ".claude\agents\knowledge-sources\"
```

After copying, write **only** `verifier.md` — substituting the actual STOP_CONDITION (never write the literal placeholder):

**`.claude/agents/verifier.md`:**

    ---
    name: verifier
    description: Runs the stop condition. Marks tasks done or failed. Never executes the goal itself.
    ---
    You are the verifier agent.
    1. Read loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md FIRST — cross-loop verification gotchas.
    2. Read [LOOP_DIR]/MEMORY.md — verification gotchas for this loop.
    3. Read [LOOP_DIR]/STATUS.md and [LOOP_DIR]/PLAN.md.
    4. Run: {STOP_CONDITION}
    5. PASSES → set State VERIFIED_PASS, mark task [x] in PLAN.md, update Task Progress. If all done: ALL DONE.
    6. FAILS → set State FAILED, write exact error to Last Executor Result.
    HARD RULE: Never execute the goal or write output files for the goal.
    HARD RULE: Never mark done unless verification actually passed.

Confirm to user:
> "loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/ created: PLAN.md · STATUS.md · MEMORY.md · TOOLS.md · RESEARCH.md · AGENTS.md
> .claude/agents/ ready: resource-scout · researcher · planner · agent-factory · executor · evaluator · verifier · auditor · memory-keeper
> Starting startup sequence..."

---

## Phase 4 — Startup Sequence

Run in this order. Each step waits for completion before the next.

### Step 1 — PARALLEL RESEARCHERS (dynamic count)

**Determine how many researchers to spawn based on goal complexity:**
- Simple, single-domain goal → 2 researchers
- Medium complexity or multi-domain goal → 3 researchers
- Large or multi-system goal (e.g. full-stack app, migration, complex refactor) → 4 researchers

**Spawn all researchers simultaneously in a single response** (call Agent tool N times at once).

Always assign each researcher a distinct focus area. Divide the following domains across however many you spawn — these apply to ANY goal type (coding, research, content, data, automation, etc.):

- **Context & Prior Work**: what already exists relevant to this goal — source files, documents, prior research, existing assets, related work, knowledge bases, prior loop learnings
- **External Knowledge & Resources**: what's available externally — APIs, documentation, datasets, libraries, services, reference materials, skills, MCP capabilities (use WebSearch/WebFetch)
- **Requirements & Constraints**: what must be true about the output — quality standards, format requirements, accuracy, edge cases, stakeholder needs, access restrictions, performance criteria (include this for 3+ researchers)
- **Environment & Integration**: how everything fits together — tools available, configuration, system dependencies, data flow, integration points, deployment targets (include this for 4 researchers)

For each researcher spawn:
```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
Focus: {ASSIGNED_DOMAIN} — {specific files and concerns for that domain}
GLOBAL DATA FIRST: read loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md and loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md.
Write findings to loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/RESEARCH.md under "## {Domain Name}".
Update STATUS.md "Last Researcher Result".
Follow .claude/agents/researcher.md.
```

Wait for ALL researchers to finish before Step 2.

### Step 2 — TOOL SCOUT

```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
GLOBAL DATA FIRST: Check loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md:
- If exists and < 7 days old: copy to loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/TOOLS.md (Status: REUSED FROM GLOBAL)
- Otherwise: discover all tools, MCPs, plugins, project scripts. Write to BOTH loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/TOOLS.md AND loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md.
Follow .claude/agents/resource-scout.md.
```

### Step 3 — PLANNER

```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
Read loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/RESEARCH.md and loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/TOOLS.md.
Create 3–7 atomic, ordered tasks appropriate to the goal type. Mark parallelism with [G1], [G2], etc.:
- Same group number = can run in parallel (independent work, no shared output state)
- Different group number = must run sequentially (later groups depend on earlier ones)
Example (research goal):
  - [ ] [G1] Gather sources on {topic} using WebSearch
  - [ ] [G1] Identify available datasets and reference materials
  - [ ] [G2] Synthesize findings into structured outline
  - [ ] [G2] Draft analysis for each section
  - [ ] [G3] Fact-check, finalize, and write output document
Replace the "## Tasks" section in loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/PLAN.md with the task list.
Update STATUS.md: Current Task = first task, Task Progress = 0 / N.
Follow .claude/agents/planner.md.
```

### Step 4 — AGENT FACTORY

```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
Read loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/PLAN.md (goal + tasks), RESEARCH.md, and TOOLS.md.
Analyze the goal domain and determine what specialized agents (beyond the core team) would improve execution quality.
Create 1–3 purpose-built agent files in loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/agents/ tailored to this goal's domain and tasks.
Write loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/AGENTS.md listing each created agent and which tasks it handles.
If the generic agents are sufficient, write AGENTS.md with "NONE CREATED" and skip creating files.
Follow .claude/agents/agent-factory.md.
```

Auto-continue into the outer loop immediately — no user confirmation needed.

---

## Phase 5 — Outer Loop

You (Claude, main session) are the outer loop controller.
**FULLY AUTONOMOUS — never pause for user input. Handle all failures automatically.**

**Initialize:**
- `turns_used = 0`, `skipped_tasks = []`
- Read PLAN.md → `total_tasks`
- `done_tasks = count of [x] tasks`

**Loop condition:** Continue while STATUS.md State ≠ `ALL DONE`.

Print each iteration: `[Task {done_tasks + 1}/{total_tasks} — {pct}% | Turn {turns_used + 1}/{MAX_TURNS}]`

---

### Step 1 — Budget check
`turns_used >= MAX_TURNS` → stop, go to Phase 6.

### Step 2 — Read state + identify current parallel group
Read STATUS.md and PLAN.md. Find all unchecked tasks with the same group tag (e.g., all `[G2]` tasks) — this is the current batch. Skip already-checked tasks.

### Step 3 — Parallel RESEARCHERS (dynamic — one per task, or more for complex tasks)

**Determine researcher count dynamically:**
- N tasks in batch → N researchers (one per task), all spawned simultaneously
- If batch has only 1 task → spawn 2 researchers for that task (implementation details + edge cases)
- If a single task is particularly complex (e.g. "implement payment system") → spawn 3 researchers for it

**Spawn all researchers simultaneously** (call Agent tool N times in one response):

For each task in the batch, spawn one researcher:
```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
GLOBAL DATA FIRST — read loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md AND loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md.
Then read loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md, PLAN.md, STATUS.md.
Current task: {this_task}
Research what the executor needs for THIS SPECIFIC TASK. Adapt to the goal type — relevant existing work, required resources, constraints, edge cases, prior failed attempts (STATUS.md).
If you discover any new skills, MCPs, datasets, APIs, or tools relevant to this task, append them to loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/TOOLS.md under "## Newly Discovered Resources".
Append findings to loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/RESEARCH.md under "## Task-Specific Research — {this_task}".
Follow .claude/agents/researcher.md.
```

Wait for ALL researchers to finish. Increment `turns_used`.

### Step 4 — Parallel EXECUTORS (one per task in batch)

**Spawn one executor per task in the current batch simultaneously:**

For each task in the batch:
```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
GLOBAL DATA FIRST — read loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md AND loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md.
Then read loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md, PLAN.md, STATUS.md.
READ BEFORE ACTING: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/RESEARCH.md — specifically "## Task-Specific Research — {this_task}".
Also read loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/AGENTS.md — if a specialized agent is defined for this task type, adopt that agent's approach.
Current task: {this_task}
Scope: work ONLY on output related to {this_task} — do not touch work being handled by other parallel tasks.
Previous attempt: {Last Executor Result for this task from STATUS.md}
Execute fully. Append any new discoveries (patterns, gotchas, tool behaviors, domain learnings) directly to loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/MEMORY.md.
Update STATUS.md "Last Executor Result" for this task.
Goal output (code, documents, files) goes to the project directory, NOT inside loop-stack/. loop-stack/ is state-only.
Follow .claude/agents/executor.md (or the specialized agent from AGENTS.md if applicable).
```

Wait for ALL executors to finish. Increment `turns_used`.

### Step 5 — Parallel MEMORY-KEEPER checkpoints

Spawn one memory-keeper per task in the batch simultaneously:
```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
Checkpoint: executor just completed "{this_task}".
Capture NEW implementation learnings to loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/MEMORY.md (local only, no global write yet).
Follow .claude/agents/memory-keeper.md.
```

Wait for all to finish.

### Step 6 — Parallel EVALUATORS (one per task in batch)

Spawn one evaluator per task simultaneously:
```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
GLOBAL DATA FIRST — read loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md AND loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md.
Read loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/RESEARCH.md — constraints and edge cases flagged for "{this_task}".
Current task: {this_task}. Evaluate quality for this specific task only. Adapt verification approach to the goal type.
Follow .claude/agents/evaluator.md.
```

Wait for ALL to finish.

### Step 7 — Parallel VERIFIERS (one per task in batch)

Spawn one verifier per task simultaneously:
```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
GLOBAL DATA FIRST — read loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md.
Current task: {this_task}.
Follow .claude/agents/verifier.md.
```

Wait for ALL to finish.

### Step 8 — Process verifier results (per task)

For each task in the batch:
- **VERIFIED_PASS** → proceed to auditor
- **FAILED, attempts < 3** → increment attempts in STATUS.md, queue for retry (back to Step 3 for this task with error context)
- **FAILED, attempts ≥ 3** → **auto-skip**: add to `skipped_tasks`, mark as skipped in STATUS.md

### Step 9 — Parallel AUDITORS (one per verified-pass task)

For each task that passed verification, spawn an auditor simultaneously:
```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
GLOBAL DATA FIRST — read loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md AND loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md.
Read loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/RESEARCH.md — constraints identified for "{this_task}".
Task just verified: {this_task}. Review for security, tech debt, pattern violations.
Follow .claude/agents/auditor.md.
```

Wait for ALL auditors to finish.

### Step 10 — Process audit results (per task)

For each task:
- **CLEAN or WARN** → proceed
- **BLOCK** → **auto-fix**: spawn executor once more with BLOCK context + re-verify. If still BLOCK → auto-skip.

### Step 11 — MEMORY-KEEPER final consolidation (single)

One memory-keeper consolidates all completed tasks in this batch:
```
Loop directory: loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/
Tasks just completed: {all tasks in this batch that passed}
Final consolidation: distill key learnings to loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/MEMORY.md.
Global write: append the most important new learning per completed task to loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md.
Follow .claude/agents/memory-keeper.md.
```

### Step 12 — Advance

- Mark each passed task [x] in PLAN.md, increment `done_tasks`, reset attempts.
- If `USE_GIT`: commit PLAN.md + STATUS.md.
- Find next unchecked group.
- If none → ALL DONE → rename `loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>/` → `loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>_DONE/` → Phase 6.
- Else → update STATUS.md → continue loop.

---

## Phase 6 — Completion Report

Write `loop-stack/<LOOP_ID>_DONE/REPORT.md` and print summary to user.

---

## Rules

- Phase 0 always first. Skip `_DONE` folders.
- **File copy**: ALWAYS use shell commands to copy agent files. Never write them manually.
- **Global data first**: Every spawn reads `loop-stack/.global/MEMORY.md` AND `loop-stack/.global/TOOLS.md` before acting.
- **Parallel first**: Spawn multiple agents simultaneously wherever possible. Same group = parallel. Different group = sequential.
- **Researcher before executor**: Always. Prevents hallucination. 2–4 researchers for startup, 1+ per task during loop.
- **Researcher propagates new resources**: If a researcher discovers a new skill, MCP, dataset, API, or tool, it appends it to TOOLS.md immediately so executors can use it.
- **Memory-keeper runs twice per task batch**: checkpoint after executors (local), consolidation after audit (local + global).
- **Each executor appends discoveries to MEMORY.md directly** — continuous memory, don't wait for memory-keeper.
- **Planner**: runs once at startup after researchers + resource-scout. Creates parallel-group-tagged task list.
- **Fully autonomous**: Never pause. 3 failures → auto-skip. Audit BLOCK → auto-fix once → skip.
- On completion: rename directory to `<LOOP_ID>_DONE/`. Phase 0 skips these.
